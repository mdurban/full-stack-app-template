1.) Clone project.

2.) `npm install` to install dependencies (for both `client/` and `server/`)

2.) `npm start` to run application (for both `client/` and `server/`)

3.) `npm test` to run tests (for both `client/` and `server/`)

## Notes
This repo is just boilerplate code and doesn't worry about security issues.

I would recommend against keeping database passwords in source code and for a production-ready application I would ust an ORM to help protect against SQL injection.
